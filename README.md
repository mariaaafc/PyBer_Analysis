# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis for a ride-sharing company that showcases the relationship between the amount of drivers and riders, as well as the cost of fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities. This would allow the company to improve access to ridesharing services, as well as help determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results

While rural cities have the lowest amount of total rides and drivers of the 3 city times, it also has the highest average fare per ride as well as highest average fare per driver. In contrast, urban cities have the highest amount of total rides and drivers, but the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Of note, urban cities have almost 10x the total fares that rural cities do. This due to the fact that although fares are less expensive in urban areas, there are significantly more riders, as well as greater driver availability.

## Summary

Three business recommendations to address any disparities among city types include: 
1. Taking a deeper look at the cause of the fare spike towards the end of February
2. Taking into consideration what other modes of transport are used in the different city types (ex. train, bus)
3. Looking at what time of day people are traveling during
